# What is Logly.zig?

Logly.zig is a high-performance, structured logging library for Zig, engineered to deliver the robust feature set of its Python and Rust counterparts while maximizing native Zig performance and safety guarantees.

## Key Features

### 🚀 Performance

- **Zero-Copy Architecture**: Minimized allocations for maximum throughput.
- **Asynchronous I/O**: Non-blocking write operations to keep your application responsive.
- **Thread-Safety**: Fully optimized for concurrent execution environments.
- **Efficient Buffering**: Configurable buffer strategies to balance latency and throughput.

### 🛠️ Flexibility

- **Comprehensive Log Levels**: 10 distinct levels (TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, NOTICE, SUCCESS, WARNING, ERROR, FAIL, CRITICAL, FATAL) for granular control.
- **Multi-Sink Support**: Simultaneously output to console, files, and custom destinations.
- **Custom Formatting**: Flexible template strings and full printf-style formatting support.
- **Rich Context**: Structured logging with JSON support and context binding.
- **Network Logging**: Send logs via TCP or UDP to remote servers or aggregators.
- **Custom Themes**: Define custom color themes for log levels.
- **Advanced Redaction**: Custom patterns and callbacks for sensitive data.
- **Persistent Context**: Scoped loggers with persistent fields.
- **Whole-Line Coloring**: ANSI colors wrap the entire log line (timestamp, level, message) for better visual scanning.
- **Custom Levels**: Define your own log levels with custom names, priorities, and colors.
- **Cross-Platform Colors**: Works on Linux, macOS, Windows 10+, and popular terminals.

### 🛡️ Reliability

- **Concurrency Safe**: Robust locking mechanisms ensure data integrity across threads.
- **Resilient Error Handling**: Comprehensive error types and recovery strategies.
- **Automated Rotation**: Sophisticated time-based and size-based file rotation.
- **Retention Management**: Automatic cleanup policies to manage disk usage.

## Design Philosophy

Logly.Zig is built upon the following core principles:

1.  **Developer Experience**: An intuitive, Python-inspired API that reduces cognitive load.
2.  **Uncompromised Performance**: Optimized for high-throughput, low-latency applications.
3.  **Type Safety**: Leveraging Zig's powerful compile-time checks to prevent runtime errors.
4.  **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Features that incur no runtime overhead when unused.
5.  **Modularity**: A composable architecture allowing you to include only what you need.
